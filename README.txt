# PING PONG GAME

THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS JAVA FILES MADE WITH PROCESSING FOR A PING PONG GAME, THAT COMMUNICATES WITH AN FPGA USING ARDUINO AS A BRIDGE.
THE GAME GOES UP TO 5 POINTS, YOU CAN RESET WITH FPGA OR WITH KEYBOARD, CAN ALSO PLAY USING FOR PLAYER 1 W(UP) AND S(DOWN),TO PLAYER 2 O(UP) AND L(DOWN)

## Background on this repository

ACTIVITY TO LEARN THE USE OF VHDL TO DESCRIBE SENSORS AS ACCELEROMETER AND ULTRASONIC.  

## How to use this repository

THE PROCESSING PART IS DIVIDED IN 3 CLASES, SCORE, PADDLE, BALL AND A MAIN.

VHDL IS FORMED BY CONTROLLER, INTERACTIONS OF COMPONENTS AND ONE ENTITY FOR ACCELEROMET, OTHER FOR ULTRASONIC, ONE FOR TRANSIMISION AND ONE FOR RECIEVE DATA.
FOR VGA WE USE AN ENTITY THAT DRAWS 4 BARS OF 2 COLORS.
